# GearNet: Geometry-Aware Relational Graph Neural Network  and Language Model for Protein-Protein Interaction Predictions. 

## Overview

*GeomEtry-Aware Relational Graph Neural Network (**GearNet**)* is a simple yet effective structure-based protein encoder. 
It encodes spatial information by adding different types of sequential or structural edges and then performs relational message passing on protein residue graphs, which can be further enhanced by an edge message passing mechanism.
Though conceptually simple, GearNet augmented with edge message passing can achieve very strong performance on several benchmarks in a supervised setting.
